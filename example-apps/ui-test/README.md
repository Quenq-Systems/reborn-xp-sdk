# Example App: UI Test

This application is a visual gallery of the standard UI components available in Reborn XP.

### Purpose
Its primary purpose is to serve as a **visual reference** for developers. When building your own custom app, run this `ui-test` app inside Reborn XP to see how each component looks and feels under the user's current theme (e.g., Luna, Royale, Zune, Classic).

You can then copy the HTML snippets from this app's source code (`ui-test.js`) and from the **[UI Component Gallery](./docs/UI_COMPONENTS.md)** documentation to build your own authentic-looking interfaces.

### Features Demonstrated:
*   Live examples of `<winbutton>`, `<grouper>`, `<wincheckbox>`, `<winradio>`, `<tab_ui>`, and more.
*   Demonstrates how a complex layout can be achieved with CSS Grid within an `<appcontentholder>`.
*   Shows how the appearance of all components automatically changes when the system theme is updated in Display Properties.
